# ArrowVortex

ArrowVortex is a simfile editor for Windows. It can be used to create or edit stepfiles for various rhythm games, such as StepMania, ITG, osu!, and other games which support DDR-style and/or PIU-style panel layouts.

This is a continuation of the original project by Bram 'Fietsemaker' van de Wetering. He has graciously allowed for the open sourcing of this code so that development can continue.

## About this project

Unfortunately, the source code for the 2017-02-25 release of ArrowVortex has been lost to time. The only surviving archive of source code was a development snapshot from 2016. A small group of volunteer developers put a lot of time and effort into restoring the full functionality of the 2017 release of ArrowVortex.

Some new features were introduced as well when preparing this release, and some bugs present in the 2017 version have been fixed as well.

## Building ArrowVortex

### Windows

In order to compile ArrowVortex on your own PC, Visual Studio is required. It is recommended to use Visual Studio 2022 with the "Desktop development for C++" components installed.

Simply open `build/VisualStudio/ArrowVortex.sln` in Visual Studio, and build the project.

### Linux

Compiling for Linux requires that you have `vcpkg`, `powershell`, and `cmake`.

Once you have those set up, run `export VCPKG_ROOT={where your vcpkg contents is}`.

This command is needed as to find and define vcpkg's root and use it when building with cmake.

Now you may run this: `cmake -B build -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-mingw-static -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${VCPKG_ROOT}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`

This command specifies that you are using a MinGW environment that is statically linked and targets 64-bit, and for cmake to account for vcpkg.

This command also requires powershell as it is used for vcpkg's copy tools, and will fail to compile if it isn't installed.

Now enter your build directory with `cd build`.

Finally, build ArrowVortex with `cmake --build .`.

## License

ArrowVortex is provided under the GPLv3 license, or at your option, any later version.

The original author provided the volunteer developers with an archive of the source code, which did not include a formal license. The original author explicitly requested that any new code developed by the volunteer developers be released under a license which prevents the code from being used in closed source software. The volunteer developers, as a separate party, have acted in good faith to comply with this request and bear no liability for the licensing status of the original code as provided to them.
