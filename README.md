# ArrowVortex

ArrowVortex is a simfile editor for Windows. It can be used to create or edit stepfiles for various rhythm games, such as StepMania, ITG, osu!, and other games which support DDR-style and/or PIU-style panel layouts.

This is a continuation of the original project by Bram 'Fietsemaker' van de Wetering. He has graciously allowed for the open sourcing of this code so that development can continue.

## Building

General dependencies:
- vcpkg
- Visual Studio (tested on VS2022) with C++20 support
- CMake (at least 3.30)

### Command line
After installing dependencies, use CMake like so:

```
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE={path to vcpkg}\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static-md ..
> cmake --build .
```

### Via Visual Studio 2022

Same build commands, but add VS2022 generator:

```
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE={path to vcpkg}\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static-md ..
```

After that, you can now open up build/ArrowVortex.sln and build inside VS2022.

## About this project

Unfortunately, the source code for the 2017-02-25 release of ArrowVortex has been lost to time. The only surviving archive of source code was a development snapshot from 2016. A small group of volunteer developers put a lot of time and effort into restoring the full functionality of the 2017 release of ArrowVortex.

Some new features were introduced as well when preparing this release, and some bugs present in the 2017 version have been fixed as well.

## Building ArrowVortex

In order to compile ArrowVortex on your own PC, Visual Studio is required. It is recommended to use Visual Studio 2022 with the "Desktop development for C++" components installed.

Simply open `build/VisualStudio/ArrowVortex.sln` in Visual Studio, and build the project.

## License

ArrowVortex is provided under the GPLv3 license, or at your option, any later version.

The original author provided the volunteer developers with an archive of the source code, which did not include a formal license. The original author explicitly requested that any new code developed by the volunteer developers be released under a license which prevents the code from being used in closed source software. The volunteer developers, as a separate party, have acted in good faith to comply with this request and bear no liability for the licensing status of the original code as provided to them.
